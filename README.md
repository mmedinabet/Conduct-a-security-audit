<h1>Conduct a security audit</h1>

<h2>Description of fictional scenario:</h2>
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department.

SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations


Dear Colleagues,



Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope,
goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.


Scope:

- <b> Current user permissions set, controls, procedures and protocols in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool. </b>
- <b> Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.</b>
- <b> Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.</b>

Goals:
- <b> To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) </b> 
- <b> Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant </b>
- <b> Fortify system controls </b> 
- <b> Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management </b>
- <b> Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks </b>
- <b> Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements </b>

Critical findings (must be addressed immediately):  


Multiple controls need to be developed and implemented to meet the audit
goals, including:
- <b> Control of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties </b> 
- <b> Disaster recovery plans </b>
- <b> Password, access control, and account management policies, including
the implementation of a password management system </b>
- <b> Encryption (for secure website transactions) </b> 
- <b> IDS </b>
- <b> Backups </b>
- <b> AV software </b>
- <b> CCTV </b> 
- <b> Locks </b>
- <b> Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy system </b> 
- <b> Fire detection and prevention systems </b> 
- <b> Policies need to be developed and implemented to meet PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements. </b>
- <b> Policies need to be developed and implemented to align to SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and overall data safety. </b>

Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):
The following controls should be implemented when possible:
- <b> Time-controlled safe </b>
- <b> Adequate lighting </b>
- <b> Locking cabinets </b> 
- <b> Signage indicating alarm service provider <b/>

Summary/Recommendations:
It's important to quickly address any problems related to following rules for online payments (PCI DSS) and data protection (GDPR) because Botium Toys accepts payments from worldwide customers, including the EU. The audit's goal is to limit permissions, so we should use advice from SOC1 and SOC2 about user access and data safety to make appropriate rules. Having plans for disasters and extra copies of things is crucial for keeping the business going during problems. Adding special software to our systems can help find and solve problems, especially since our old systems need constant watching. To make Botium Toys' building safer, we should use locks and cameras to protect things and watch for issues. Later on, it would be good to use codes and special safes, bright lights, locked boxes, and signs to improve security.
